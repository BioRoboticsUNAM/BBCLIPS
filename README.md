BBCLIPS
=======

An interface to BlackBoard (our "home-made" message passing and shared variables hub... somewhat equivalent to ROS) from python with a CLIPS interpreter embeded using pyCLIPS.

This software depends on the library pyRobotics, which is our API to create modules that connect to the BlackBoard.

These softwares are all part of the work developed at the Bio-Robotics Laboratory at UNAM, and are used in our service robots.

This is for now provided as free for the public domain.
There's currently no documentation (neither for BBCLIPS module, nor for the BlackBoard or the pyRobotics) and it is still in beta testing, but if someone should be interested in knowing more about any of these projects, you can contact me at adrianrc[dot]89[at]gmail[dot]com.
