BBCLIPS
=======

An interface to BlackBoard (our "home-made" message passing and shared variables hub... somewhat equivalent to ROS) from python with a CLIPS interpreter embeded using pyCLIPS.

This software depends on the library pyRobotics, which is our python API to create modules that connect to the BlackBoard.
(We also have a C# and C++ APIs, although the latter is also under development and has not been tested thoroughly)

These softwares are all part of the work developed at the Bio-Robotics Laboratory at UNAM, and are used in our service robots.

There's currently no documentation (neither for BBCLIPS module, nor for the BlackBoard or the pyRobotics) and it is still in beta testing, but if someone should be interested in knowing more about any of these projects, you can contact me at adrianrc[dot]89[at]gmail[dot]com.
